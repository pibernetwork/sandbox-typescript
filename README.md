# Sandbox 3

Sandbox to test proof of concepts oportunities on improve Typescript development

## Intention

- Become pro on typescript.
- Test typescript ideas on isolation.
- Keep one single repository of typescript studies.

## Fundations

It's common to have doubts about how to architect code using typescript due to their complexity.

This can or not work based on your previous understanding of the documentation.
Some docs are old dated and could not work in current version.

Make tests on client projects is not the best idea. You should have an environment ready for any typescript question anytime.

This will enforce the use of the best practices even for small functions.

## Expectations

- Track the typescript evolution.
- It can serve as a guide for everyone that want to know if something works.
- Test all typescript module kits configurations.
- Test publish or h
- Understand how to work with all types of javascript bundles.

## Features

- Simple packages with well tested proof of concepts about typescript in isolation.

## Limits

- It should be only for proof of concepts, it's not intended to integrate with any other technology than typescript and it's packages.
